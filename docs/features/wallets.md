# Wallets

Wallets give you an overview of **all your assets** (in ETH, SLP, AXS and Axies) across all wallets associated with your scholarship.

Scroll down and you’ll be able to see and sort by how much ETH, SLP, AXS and Axies each wallet contains.

**Add Wallet** by clicking the button on the right. Enter:

* Type
* Alias
* Ronin address

The first wallet with the coin icon next to it is your **designated treasury wallet** – the wallet that receives the "Manager" share when [payments](payments.md) are processed. Set any wallet as the treasury from the action menu on the right.

Easily **search for wallets** by filtering for labels and/or entering the account name, alias, or ronin address in the search bar.
