# Payments

One of the most time-consuming and error-prone tasks when running an Axie scholarship is processing **accurate, transparent, secure and detailed payments**.

With this feature, whether you have 10 or 1,000 scholars, you will be able to **process batch payments with a few clicks**.

If you decide to invite your [scholars via email](user-management.md#invite-user-from-user-management), they can also view historic payments and the breakdown of how they were paid. Scholars invited have **read-only access to your account**.

1. To **start a payment plan**, click into “Generate Payments.”

2. Select your payment start and earn date, and “Generate.”

Note that when choosing a date range, it only picks up scholars _based on their last paid day_.

For example:

* If the scholar was last paid today, there would be no payment to generate.
* If the scholar was last paid on Nov 1, 2021, it will generate a payment for the scholar’s earnings between Nov 1, 2021 and today.

3. In **Payment Events**, you will see:

    * Transaction date _(start to end_)
    * How many scholars are eligible to be paid
    * Total payment amount
    * Payment status

4. Click into the payment to see **Payment Details**.
    * Start and end date
    * Scholar name and ronin address
    * When the scholar was last paid
    * Scholar, manager and trainer SLP amount
    * Total SLP earned
    * Payment status

5. To **double-check total SLP earned**, click on the ronin address to view all transactions associated with that wallet.

6. Click on the action menu on the right to **edit the scholar or delete the generated scholar payment**.

7. **Expand each payment event** by clicking on the arrow on the left, which will show you something of an itemized invoice. You will see who and how much each person gets paid, usually the scholar, manager and trainer, if any.

8. Before starting payments, if you wish to **modify any payment**, click “Add More,” where you can edit by adding or subtracting SLP. This is useful for any bonuses, deductions, previous errors in payment, and more. After making any modification, click “Regenerate” to refresh the page. This should take a few seconds.

9. To **pay your scholars**, click “Start Payments.”

10. To watch the payouts occur, select "[Wallet Commander](wallet-commander.md)” from the Settings icon at the top right corner. Here, you will **see the transaction being updated on the blockchain in real time**.

And that’s payments done and dusted – sans messy excel sheets, SLP confusions, over- and under-paying scholars every month.
