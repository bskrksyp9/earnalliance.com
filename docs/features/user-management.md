# User Management

2 types of users can be **invited to create Earn Management accounts via email.**

1. Admins who have accounts can manage and access all features of the account.
2. Scholars who have accounts can view:
   * Activity and performance 
   * Historic payments and breakdowns of how they got paid
   * Note that scholars have **read-only **access to your account

## Invite User
There are two ways to invite users depending on what you are doing.

### Invite user from tracker

Using the [Tracker](tracker.md), you may invite a user while adding/editing an account.

When adding or editing an account, click on "scholar’s payment ronin address" _(this is the account your scholar is paid in)._

**Adjust the toggle** on the right to enter their email address instead. If they do not have an account, an invitation will be sent to their email address.

Earn Management has a portal for managing users.

2. Select “Manage and Invite Users” from the Settings icon.
