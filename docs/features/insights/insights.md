# Insights  

As a scholarship owner or manager, how do you keep track of accounts attached to inactive scholars? Do you scroll through your tracker to flag the accounts that have logged 0 SLP today? Do you then repeat this time-consuming process the day after, and the one after that? 

Our Insights feature allows you to **quickly** **audit your scholars’ performance** and **immediately identify consistently high-performing, under-performing or inactive accounts**. 

You can do this using 3 filters:

1. Date range: Select the last 3, 7, 14, or 30 days 
2. Daily SLP: Select the amount/range of SLP a scholar has earned per day 
3. Number of Days: Select the  # of days the scholar has earned the selected daily amount/range of SLP

The accounts that meet the selected criteria will appear below. For each account, you'll be able to see: 

* The # of days it logged x amount or range of daily SLP
* Today’s SLP 
* Yesterday’s SLP 
* Week SLP: Week avg daily SLP
* Month SLP: Last 30 day avg daily SLP
* MMR
* Lifetime value

### Inactive Accounts 

The best use case of this feature is **screening for accounts that have not been active**. 

For example: You'd like to vet for inactive accounts that have logged 0 SLP for 3 days within the last 3 days.

1. Select “Last 3 Days” for time frame 
2. On the “Daily SLP” slider, drag it to 0 
3. On the “# Days” slider, drag it to 3 days

You will see below that in this scholarship, 98 accounts have registered 0 SLP every day for the last 3 days.

Beyond the day-to-day account tracking, the Insights feature gives you a high-level, big-picture view of 1) which and 2) the number of accounts that are performing in a specific category.
