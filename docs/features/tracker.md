# Scholar Tracker

Our tracker is used to monitor your accounts associated with the ronin addresses used to play Axie Infinity.

That enables our system to **track the scholars’ performances** and their **wallets’ earnings** over time. Additional information, such as historical earnings and Axies, can be tracked as well.

## Add Account


Add each scholar’s account by filling in the following information:


1. Account name (i.e. scholar-01)
2. Ronin address (this is the account your scholar plays on)
3.Scholar’s % revenue share 
 
After entering your scholar’s %, the manager’s % revenue share will be automatically updated to equal 100%.

### Optional Account Details

The following fields are optional for accounts.

4. Scholar’s payment ronin address (this is the account your scholar is paid in)

Directly enter your scholar’s payment ronin address, or if that’s not available, **adjust the toggle** on the right to use the scholar’s email address. 

You can either:

* Enter the scholar's email address
* If they don’t already have an Earn Management account, [invite them via email](www.google.com) in the same field.


--TODO: Image --

Note that **to use our [Payments](www.google.com) feature**, your scholar’s payment ronin address must be entered.

5. Labels

Labels are used to organize your accounts for quick search and filtering capabilities.

Enter as many tags as you wish to help you quickly filter and organize your scholars, such as: 

* GUILD-1
* TEAM-BLUE
* NINJA-SQUAD

6. Trainer’s ronin address 

This can be a mentor or investor that gets a revenue share off this scholar.

Again, if the payment address is not available, adjust the toggle to enter the trainer’s email address instead. 

7. Trainer’s % revenue share

The manager, scholar and trainer’s % revenue share will automatically add up to 100%. This share percentage will be deducted from the manager’s share pool.

8. Last paid date

Enter the last date the scholar was paid. By leaving it blank, it will default to today’s date.
