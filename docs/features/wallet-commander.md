# Wallet Commander

The Wallet Commander is an open-source utility that allows Earn Management to **remote control your private keys without having direct access to them**. 

The owner of the wallet(s) that are being managed by a third party, such as Earn Management, can **register private keys with specific permissions on what the third party is allowed to do with them**.

The tool will be open-sourced so that the code can be audited for safety and security. We expect to release the alpha version of the Wallet Commander by the end of March 2022.
