# Wallet Commander

The wallet commander is an open source utility that allows Earn Management to remote control your
private keys without having direct access to them. The owner of the wallet(s) that are being managed
by a 3rd party, such as Earn Management, can register private keys which specific permissions on
what a 3rd party is allowed to do with them.

The tool will be open sourced so that the code can be audited for safety and security.

We expect to release the alpha version of the Wallet Commander by the end of March 2022.
